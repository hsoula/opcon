= Introduction =

There are three main places where the project must be extensible. They are described here.


= Models = 
Each unit is an entity which is a union of a state (data that changes from unit to another) and a number of Stateless models. The models are:
  * [logistics]
  * [combat]
  * [movement]
  * [C3]
  * [intelligence]

Each unit is defined by inheritable templates which contain a model or a template for a model for each of the modules. All of the data is stored in XML files, which can be edited by hand, or eventually with some kind of UI.

A user should be able to:
  * Create unit template by putting together a set of existing models.
  * Insert new model template in custom or base definition files.
  * Define models directly in unit templates.
  * Never have to copy/paste data, use inheritance instead.
  * Easily define variants by adding only the necessary modifications after inheriting a template.
