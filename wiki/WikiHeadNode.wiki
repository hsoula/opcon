If you want a quick gist of the project, please look at the [BasicPrinciple principle] page, or browse a list of [features] for this project.

= Guides =
  * [DesignerGuide] - for scenario designer and umpires
  * [PlayerGuide] - for players and observers.

= Design Principles =

  * [Extensibility] -- Defining what matters, and nothing else more than that.
  * [Realism] -- Take the same decision in the sim as you would in real life.
  * [NoMicromanagement] -- Lots of details, and a robust AI to handle them.

= Milestones =

  * Milestone 1 : Refactor such that a simulation can be loaded, ran and saved from XML files input and returns everything to XML. The simulation must be able to include one or no entity.
 
  * Milestone 2 : Increment on MS1 by allowing multiple entities and thus restore the ability to handle chains of commands and contacts.

= UseCase =
Here is a link to design narratives that are there to help defining features of gameplay and for modeling.
