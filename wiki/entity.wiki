#summary The basic element that can be controlled in the simulation.

= Principle =
An entity is a collation of a few elements:
* Identification of the entity and the command echelon that it controls.
* [State] data which is unit specific and changes over time.
* Models which are stateless, and act as controllers to resolve various aspect of the entities' actions.

= Reading in an Entity from a Scenario definition =
An entity must be embedded in a <OOB> tag which itself is embedded in a <side> node. The bulk of the information for an entity can be templated.
