= General Principle =
The logistics models is concerned with the tracking of materiel during a scenario. The materiel is stored in a custom data structure called the [supply_package]. Units have the following properties:

Stateless properties
  # capacity : a supply_package that represent the maximal quantity of materiel that a unit can lift with its organic assets. 
  # Consumption_rate : There are four consumption rates:
    # idle : materiel expenditure in STON per hour when the unit/system does nothing.
    # transit : materiel expenditure when the unit is relocating.
    # combat : materiel expenditure when the unit/system if fighting.
    # service : materiel expenditure when the unit/system is providing CSS. 
  # basic_load: the number of hours for each consumption_rate class that a unit will attempt to maintain through routine resupply requests.

State properties
  # cargo : the quantity of materiel transported by the unit's organic assets.
  # mounted dismounts: The number of personel lifted for ferry or relocation ops. Doesn't include the crew of the vehicle itself.

= XML examples =
The basic definition. It has no capacity for materiel nor passenger lift. It has no crew. By default, all logistic models inherit 72 hours of *idle* activity supply, 6 for *transit* and 1 hour of intense combat. The basicload property is meaningless in the base example. Finally, the base model doesn't expand any supply, regardless of the unit's activity.
