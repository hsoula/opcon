If you want a quick gist of the project, please look at the [principle](BasicPrinciple.md) page, or browse a list of [features](features.md) for this project.

# Guides #
  * [DesignerGuide](DesignerGuide.md) - for scenario designer and umpires
  * [PlayerGuide](PlayerGuide.md) - for players and observers.

# Design Principles #

  * [Extensibility](Extensibility.md) -- Defining what matters, and nothing else more than that.
  * [Realism](Realism.md) -- Take the same decision in the sim as you would in real life.
  * [NoMicromanagement](NoMicromanagement.md) -- Lots of details, and a robust AI to handle them.

# Milestones #

  * Milestone 1 : Refactor such that a simulation can be loaded, ran and saved from XML files input and returns everything to XML. The simulation must be able to include one or no entity.

  * Milestone 2 : Increment on MS1 by allowing multiple entities and thus restore the ability to handle chains of commands and contacts.

# UseCases #
Here is a link to design narratives that are there to help defining features of gameplay and for modeling.
