# Narrative #
B Sqdn is ordered to clear the area to the left of the MSR. This area is defined by one AO which includes a village. Securing an area means that all the area must be covered by the visual sensor. In a village, this means that all houses must be checked. The Area of the village is 100mX100m, or 10,000m^2, where the average visual range is 10m. This means that the unit must conceptually cover some 25 20mX20m blocks before calling the area secure. 25 X 20m means a displacement of 500m, while in combat stance. If the friction in this are is 0.1, then the secure operation would be the equivalent of moving 5km in combat deployment, which means 1h for footmen.


# Analysis #
  * Securing means plotting movement such that all area can be covered by the most appropriate sensor.
  * Visual is the default sensor.
  * Infrastructures should define area and mean visual ranges. Default must exist for terrain types.
  * Multiple level building increase the effective area of a polygon as they require to consider separately the same 2D areas more than once. Some kind of stats on the coverage of building, and the average number of level should be provided to come up with estimates.
